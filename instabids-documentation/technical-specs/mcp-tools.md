# Multi-Context Programming (MCP) Tools

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Multi-Context Programming (MCP) tools available for the InstaBids platform development.

## Overview

Multi-Context Programming tools enable developers to work across multiple programming contexts simultaneously, leveraging AI, automation, and specialized interfaces to streamline development workflows. These tools are essential for the InstaBids ecosystem where blockchain, frontend, and backend technologies must interact seamlessly.

## Available MCP Tools

### 1. Assistive AI Development Tools

#### Claude AI Integration
- **Description**: Advanced AI assistant integration for code development, technical documentation, and problem-solving.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Automated code review and suggestions
  - Documentation generation
  - Architectural planning assistance
  - Problem-solving and debugging support
  - Natural language to code generation

#### GitHub Copilot
- **Description**: AI pair programmer that integrates with development environments.
- **Usage**: Assists in code completion, suggesting entire functions and approaches based on context.

### 2. Cross-Context Development Tools

#### WebAssembly (WASM) Bridge
- **Description**: Tool for compiling high-performance code that runs across JavaScript and blockchain environments.
- **Implementation**: Used in InstaBids for computationally intensive operations that span browser and Solana contexts.
- **Benefits**: Enables shared code logic between frontend applications and on-chain programs.

#### TypeScript Unified Schema
- **Description**: Single source of truth for data schemas used across frontend, backend, and smart contracts.
- **Implementation**: Schema definitions auto-generate TypeScript interfaces, Solana contract structures, and database models.
- **Benefits**: Ensures data consistency across the entire application stack.

### 3. Blockchain Development Tools

#### Solana MCP Bridge
- **Description**: Specialized toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying Solana smart contracts from TypeScript/JavaScript environments.
- **Features**:
  - Contract simulation in JavaScript environment
  - Automated test generation
  - Transaction builders with type safety
  - On-chain/off-chain data synchronization

#### Anchor Framework Extensions
- **Description**: Extended Anchor framework tools with InstaBids-specific functionality.
- **Components**:
  - Custom account serialization/deserialization
  - Program Derived Address (PDA) management utilities
  - Transaction batching optimization
  - Fee estimation and management

### 4. Frontend/Backend Bridge Tools

#### API Generator
- **Description**: Tool that generates type-safe API clients from server specifications.
- **Implementation**: Creates frontend service layers that match backend endpoints exactly, with full type safety.
- **Benefits**: Eliminates manual synchronization between frontend and backend interfaces.

#### Reactive Data Bridge
- **Description**: Real-time data synchronization layer between frontend and backend.
- **Implementation**: Uses WebSockets and reactive programming patterns to keep UI in sync with server state.
- **Benefits**: Reduces development time for real-time features like bidding and notifications.

### 5. Testing and Deployment MCP Tools

#### Cross-Context Test Runner
- **Description**: Testing framework that can simultaneously test frontend, backend, and blockchain code.
- **Features**:
  - End-to-end test scenarios across all layers
  - Automated contract state verification
  - UI interaction simulation tied to blockchain state

#### Unified Deployment Pipeline
- **Description**: CI/CD tooling that understands dependencies across contexts.
- **Implementation**: Coordinates deployments so that compatible versions of frontend, backend, and contracts are always deployed together.
- **Benefits**: Prevents version mismatch issues between system components.

## Integration with InstaBids Development Workflow

### Development Process

The MCP tools integrate into the InstaBids development workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Use Claude AI to assist with architectural design and technology selection
   - Generate initial schemas with TypeScript Unified Schema

2. **Development Phase**:
   - Leverage GitHub Copilot for code assistance
   - Use API Generator to create consistent interfaces
   - Apply Solana MCP Bridge for smart contract development

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Employ Cross-Context Test Runner for comprehensive testing
   - Use WASM Bridge for performance testing across contexts

4. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Utilize Unified Deployment Pipeline for coordinated releases
   - Apply automatic verification of cross-context compatibility

### Best Practices

When working with MCP tools:

1. Always define data models in the unified schema first
2. Leverage type generation rather than manual type definitions
3. Use simulation environments before deploying to testnets
4. Take advantage of AI assistance for repetitive coding tasks
5. Write tests that verify behavior across contexts, not just within them

## Future MCP Tools Development

The InstaBids platform roadmap includes the development of new MCP tools:

1. **AI-Powered Transaction Analyzer**: For security and performance optimization
2. **Cross-Chain Bridge Development Kit**: For future expansion beyond Solana
3. **Automated Documentation Synchronizer**: To keep technical documentation in sync with code
4. **Visual MCP Programming Interface**: For non-technical stakeholders to participate in development

## Getting Started with MCP Tools

To begin using these tools:

1. Install the InstaBids Development Kit (IDK):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @instabids/idk
   ```

2. Initialize a cross-context project:
   ```bash
   idk init my-feature --contexts=frontend,backend,contract
   ```

3. Generate a unified schema:
   ```bash
   idk generate schema --from models/myModel.ts
   ```

4. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   idk dev
   ```

For detailed documentation on each tool, refer to the specific tool documentation in the `/instabids-documentation/tools/` directory.
